- Tuesday September 14 - Linked VSCode with github using git, can now push without having to go
	through the Github editor
- Finished git tutorial I had started last week, very informative, still feeling a little shaky on certain things, 
but I'm sure with practice will get better.
- Spent a decent amount of time looking through the Git documentation, watched some youtube videos

</div>
<div>
- Wednesday September 15 - Created another github pages site for html files, used that to host change log and 
to do instead of just linking to the repository; took a lot longer than I expected, learned some of the differences between
md files and html files; still don't fully understand the differences
</div>
<div>
    Thursday September 16 - Created the most basic of basic websites using the most basic of basic html 
    Will add features that integrate with other aspects of the rubric in the coming week
    - Mostly spent the week working on improving my skills with git. Unfortunately didn't have as much time to work
    on other things this week, which will probably reflect in my grade, but next week I should have much more alotted time
    to spend on the other categories on the rubric, and finally start developing some real projects.

    Monday September 20 - Simple calculator through typescript, very simplistic, not hard, but good to begin understanding typescript syntax and understand 
    how typescript compiles into javascript.
</div>

<div>
    Tuesday September 21 through 23 - Took simple calculator skeleton, turned it into a react app, using various helper sites and other example react apps,
    but getting a lot of it done through trial and error. Still a skeleton of a real calculator, missing many basic functions, but works nonetheless
